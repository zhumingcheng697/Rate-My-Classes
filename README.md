## Privacy

Rate My Classes stores the user’s random user id, username, stars, reviews, and settings in the database. If the user is signed up by email, their email address will also be recorded for authentication purposes. If a user wants to review for classes, in order to ensure the authenticity of the reviews, they first need to verify their account with an nyu.edu email address, which will be used only once to receive a confirmation code but this NYU email will _not_ be recorded. No additional data is collected by Rate My Classes. Users can easily delete their account and optionally remove all their data directly in the app with a single tap. If the user used Sign in with Apple or Sign in with Google, their Apple ID or Google account will also be unlinked when they delete their Rate My Classes account in the app.
